# dx.grid.extensions

This is a comprehensive wrapper around devexpress js grids which offers conditional formatting features, expression editors, on the fly custom column creation and automatic schema creation.

At the time, those features are tightly coupled to our widget framework and we're working to modularize it as part of a huge code base spring cleanup. 

Given the huge demand by devexpress users for those features, it's seems a good idea to open source it.
